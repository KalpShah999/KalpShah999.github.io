        <p>
            My name is Kalp Shah, and I love programming!
            Though I currently residing in Brampton Ontario, I'm attending second year as a Software Engineering Co-op student at McMaster University. 
            Over the past 5 years, I've worked with various programming languages such as Java, Python, Javascript, React, C#, HTML, and Scratch. 
            I've worked on many projects including game development projects, which is my main interest in programming.
            I'm currently pursuing many opportunities to enhance and showcase my knowledge within the domain of software and game development.
