                    <p>
                        On October 30, 2012, Electronic Arts released a remake of their earlier game "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Most_Wanted_(2005_video_game)">Need For Speed: Most Wanted</a>", called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_Speed:_Most_Wanted_(2012_video_game)">Need For Speed: Most Wanted (2012)</a>."
                        Most Wanted is a street racing game set in the fictional town called "<a href="https://nfs.fandom.com/wiki/Fairhaven_City">Fairhaven City</a>". 
                        With illegal street racing filling the streets, the player seeks to challenge as many drivers around the city to gain repution, and become the city's most wanted.  
                        Although the name of the game didn't change much, it's updated gameplay and graphics made a huge impact.
